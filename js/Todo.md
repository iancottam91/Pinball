# Pinball

## Issues to solve

### calculate collisions with circles

- what if the collision is not a flush hit e.g. on next step they intersect each other - can cause a bug

need a class that does the moving
and a  class that does the calculating


- improve structure of code
- set up a balls class - dont just use the experiment one


- my formula assumes both balls are moving! and the same mass(radius)
